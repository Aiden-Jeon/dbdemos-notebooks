# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the previous notebook, we have investigated the evaluation input to create an evaluation dataset and benchmark newer version against it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because Databricks also tracks all your customer discussions, we can also deploy online monitoring, directly reviewing where your model doesn't perform well (e.g. by providing your customer simple way to flag incorrect answers) and trigger alerts and ask for your expert to improve your dataset!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is also a good opportunity to either improve your documentation or adjust your prompt, and ultimately add the correct answer to your evaluation dataset!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **We'll improve this demo soon to show you how you can automate this and leverage a Lakehouse Monitor on your table with alerts!**
